    "# Monopoly - probability of hitting a particular space after N cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_The game of monopoly is played on a square board with 10 spaces per side (so 40 in total). A player starts at the space marked \"go\" and on each turn rolls two sided dice, advancing forward a number of spaces equal to the sum of the two numbers that lands face up. (if a player rolls a sum that would normally cause them to advance past the 40th square, they will instead loop around, so if a player landed on a hypothetical 44th square, they will instead go to the 4th square on the board). What is the probability that a player after they \"loop around\" the board 9 times, lands on the space \"Boardwalk\" (the 40th square) before they \"loop around\" the board an eleventh time?_"

We could rephrase it as - starting from 0, keep throwing two dice and adding the score. What is the probability of the sum being exactly 400 at some point? "
